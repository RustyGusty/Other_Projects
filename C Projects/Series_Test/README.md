Code to brute-force test for divergence the series for Q5c in the 2020 final exam for ESC195 (https://exams.skule.ca/exams/MAT195H1_20201_631653356828esc195%20exam%202020.pdf)

Discovered that the series passes a value of 3 after around 2000 terms, and a value of 4 after around 2 trillion terms, so concluded that the series (probably) diverges

Also tested the same series but with squared terms, and came to the conclusion that it converges to about 1.645, which helped reveal the method with which to confirm the divergence of the original question

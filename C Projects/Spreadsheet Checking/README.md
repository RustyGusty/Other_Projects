I play a game called FTL, and it's fun to note down my wins and losses (trying to get an unbroken streak of wins with every ship on hard mode).

However, when I tried to tabulate the weapons used, I noticed that the sums weren't adding up, meaning I had mistyped some names

This code is simply to compile all the weapons I had written and, checking against my defined weapons list, show all the incorrect ones so I could fix them in the spreadsheet
